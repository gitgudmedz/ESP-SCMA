                                            Success becomes liable arising from such materials for which (i) no copyright permission or previous release was requested, or (ii) for uses which exceed the uses allowed pursuant to a permission
                                            or release, including but not limited to any claim brought by a third party alleging that such materials or derivatives thereof, or ERP Success’s use, migration, transformation or other
                                            modification of such materials at the request of Client and/or pursuant to and as required by this Agreement, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party or
                                            violates applicable law. ERP Success agrees to notify Client promptly in writing of any such claim or suit and shall give Client control of the defense and/or settlement of any such action. Client
                                            agrees that it shall not enter into any settlement agreement requiring any action or admission by ERP Success without ERP Success’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
                                            withheld. ERP Success shall have the right to hire its own counsel solely for the purpose of monitoring any such action, at ERP Success’s own expense.&nbsp; Client shall not be liable for any
                                            costs or expenses incurred by ERP Success without Client’s prior written authorization.&nbsp;

                                            that performance or of that right. The waiver of a right under the Agreement by a party will not be effective unless it is given in a signed writing, in which case it will be effective in the
                                            specific instance and for the specific purpose given. The debtor of an obligation under the Agreement will be in default of that obligation by the mere lapse of time for performing it.
